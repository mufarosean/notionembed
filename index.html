    "Freedom is the possibility of isolation. You are free if you can withdraw from people, not having to seek them out for the sake of money, company, love, glory or curiosity, none of which can thrive in silence and solitude. If you can’t live alone, you were born a slave. - Fernando Pessoa",
    "Man is condemned to be free. - Jean-Paul Sartre",
    "The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself. - Friedrich Nietzsche",
    "I am not a thing, but a pattern of my life, a configuration of experiences. - Michel de Montaigne",
    "The self is only that which it is in the process of becoming. - Søren Kierkegaard",
    "Freedom is not a possession to be gained, it is the experience of being in the world with the capacity to create and shape that world. - Simone de Beauvoir",
    "Man is condemned to freedom. - Jean-Paul Sartre",
    "Freedom is not the absence of commitments, but the ability to choose - and commit myself to - what is best for me. - Paulo Coelho",
    "The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive, but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer. - Arnold Toynbee",
    "We are our choices. - Jean-Paul Sartre",
    "The most common form of despair is not being who you are. - Søren Kierkegaard",
    "To be free is not to have the power to do anything you want; it is to be able to surpass the given toward an open future. - Simone de Beauvoir",
    "Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you. - Jean-Paul Sartre",
    "The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself. - Friedrich Nietzsche",
